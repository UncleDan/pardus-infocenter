REQUIREMENTS
In order to install and use the Pardus Infocenter,
you must have a web host that has PHP and allows you to access the SQL server.

To use the Greasemonkey script (which is included), Firefox and the Greasemonkey extension are required.

INSTALLATION
1) Create a new database and import "/mysql/install-db.sql" in phpMyAdmin
a. Alternatively, if you don't have any other installations of the Pardus Infocenter, you could import "/mysql/install-db.sql" into an existing database.
2) Open up "/infocenter/modules/settings_mod.php" and specify your "DB Settings."
3) Copy the content of the "/infocenter" folder to the appropriate folder on your web host.
4) Open up "/infocenter/pardus_infocenter_share.user.js" and edit the settings under "SERVERS."
5) Go to "http://www.yourdomain.com/(path)/infocenter" and test your login and password. Default logins are the following (Login/Password, case sensitive):
a. Orion-View/Pardus
b. Artemis-View/Pardus
c. Pegasus-View/Pardus
6) If you log in successfully, proceed to download and test the Greasemonkey Script. If not, go back to step 2 and make sure that your settings are correct.
7) Your setup should be finished. See the next section for options on how to customize your installation.

CUSTOMIZATION

* ACCOUNTS
	Here is how to add multiple accounts for your Infocenter.
1) Open up phpMyAdmin
2) Select the Database that you imported the Infocenter "install-db.sql"
3) Click on "Accounts" and click to "Browse"
4) Make note of the ID of the last account.
5) Click "Insert" and enter in the next ID number from the one you noted.
6) Fill out the information, specifying a Universe, Username, and Permission setting.
7) For the password, you will need to convert it into a MD5 format. Go to "http://md5-hash-online.waraxe.us/" and enter in the desired password. Once it is converted, copy and paste that value into the "Password" field.
8) Click to insert entry, and test your login to see if it works.
MAIN PAGE
In this version of the Pardus Infocenter, you have the option to customize and create your very own main page.
1) Go to "/modules/settings_mod.php" and change the values of MAIN_PAGE_TITLE, MAIN_PAGE_IMAGE and MAIN_PAGE_DESCRIPTION;
2) If you wish a deeper customization, open "/main.php" and edit accordingly. 

If you feel that you do not want "main.php" to be your main page, then follow these steps: 

1) Go to "/modules/settings_mod.php"
2) Find the following line:
		const PAGE_STARTING_PAGE = "main"; 
3) Change "main" to one of the other options listed (combats/hacks/mission).
4) Find the following line:
		const ENABLE_MAIN_PAGE = true; 
5) Change "true" to "false."

2) Select the Database where you installed the "install-db.sql."
3) Click "Export."
4) Select the appropriate tables (account/combat/hack/mission).
